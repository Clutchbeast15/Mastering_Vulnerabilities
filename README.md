# 🔍 Mastering_Vulnerabilities

Welcome to **Mastering_Vulnerabilities** — a curated collection of smart contract vulnerabilities, their proof-of-concepts (PoCs), and mitigation strategies. This repository documents my hands-on journey to mastering smart contract auditing, especially within the DeFi ecosystem.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

To deeply understand how smart contract vulnerabilities arise, how they can be exploited, and how they should be mitigated — all through real code, structured learning, and an auditor’s mindset.

---

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here

Each folder in this repository focuses on **one vulnerability** and contains:

- 📚 **Explainer** — What is the vulnerability? Why does it occur?
- ⚔️ **PoC** — A minimal, reproducible example demonstrating the exploit.
- 🛡️ **Mitigation** — How to fix or prevent it with best practices.
- ✅ **Tests** — Foundry/Echidna-based test cases proving the exploit and fix.
